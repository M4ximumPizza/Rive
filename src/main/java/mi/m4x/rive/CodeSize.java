 * This class provides constants representing different code sizes.

 *
 * <p>Code sizes are represented as integers, with the following values:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>UNKNOWN: The code size is unknown.</li>
 *     <li>CODE16: The code size is 16 bits.</li>
 *     <li>CODE32: The code size is 32 bits.</li>
 *     <li>CODE64: The code size is 64 bits.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>These constants can be used in various contexts where code size needs to be specified or checked.</p>
